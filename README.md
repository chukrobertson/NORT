<h3>Written by Angie Xenga | Ed Zaurak | August 2012</h3>
A derivative script work from D> Concept Car by Damen Hax with ZMO Autoworks Engine Script Snipbits & Additions.
The idea of project is to develope a good vehicle script with less memeory to use in-world. 
To accomodate other vehicles in the same sim space.
Also to give some realistic movements. (More arcade then real given the limitation of SL physics.)

This is the result of 2 year LSL research (+ additional time from others).
